# What are missing data?

---
# Common missing data scenarios

--
 * Missing data in prediction

--
  * ML models typically compute something like `\(P(y \mid x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)\)`

--
  * What if some `\(x_k\)` is unknown?

--
  * Need to somehow compensate for `\(x_k\)` with variables which are present

--
  * Spoiler alert! Right thing to do is to average over possible values

---
# Common missing data scenarios, cont'd

 * Missing data in training

--
  * "Training" == adjusting parameters to better fit available data

--
  * Data typically == list of tuples of variables `\((x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, y)\)`

--
  * Each tuple makes some contribution to the overall goodness of fit

--
  * How to compute the contribution when some tuples have missing values?

--
  * Spoiler alert! Again, right thing to do is to average over possible values

---
# A Bayesian framework for approaching missing data problems

--
 * "Bayesian" = model all uncertainties as probabilities

--
 * consistent strategy: compute conditional probability given what you know, and averaging over what you don't know

--
 * Averaging means integrating -- this can be computationally intensive

--
 * ... but you always know what you're aiming for

---
# An aside about Bayesian inference

---
# Solutions for specific problems derived from the general framework

---
# Looking at conventional heuristics from a Bayesian point of view

--
 * Single imputation

  * replace missing value with per-variable mean or most common value

  * something like approximating integral with one-point sample

--
 * Multiple imputation

  * sample from marginal distribution

  * sample from distribution conditional on other variables

  * multiple imputation is essentially same as Bayesian approach

--
 * "Hot deck" imputation -- replace with most similar complete record

  * something like sampling from empirical conditional distribution

--
 * One model per combination of missing variables

---
