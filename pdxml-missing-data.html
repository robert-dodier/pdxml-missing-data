# What are missing data?

--

 * Datum = assignment of a specific value to a variable

--

 * Record = tuple of data associated with a specific subject or experimental unit

--

 * Missing data = data for which the specific value is unknown

--

 * Example: (age = 72, gender = male, height = ?, smoking = ?)

---
## Common scenarios, #1:  missing data in prediction

--

 * ML models typically compute something like `\(P(y \mid x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)\)`

--

 * What if some `\(x_k\)` is unknown?

--

 * Need to somehow compensate for `\(x_k\)` with variables which are present

--

 * Spoiler alert! Right thing to do is to average over possible values

---
## Common scenarios, #2: missing data in training

--

 * "Training" == adjusting parameters to better fit available data

--

 * Data typically == list of tuples of variables `\((x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, y)\)`

--

 * Each tuple makes some contribution to the overall goodness of fit

--

 * How to compute the contribution when some tuples have missing values?

--

 * Spoiler alert! Again, right thing to do is to average over possible values

---
## A Bayesian framework for approaching missing data problems

--

 * "Bayesian" = model all uncertainties as probabilities

--

 * consistent strategy: compute conditional probability given what you know, and averaging over what you don't know

--

 * Averaging means integrating -- this can be computationally intensive

--

 * ... but you always know what you're aiming for

---
# Applying the Bayesian framework

--

 * When some `$x$`'s are missing, and some are present,
 our goal is to find `\(P(y \mid \mathrm{present})\)`

--

 * Given a model `\(P(y \mid \mathrm{missing}, \mathrm{present})\)`

--

 * we find `\(P(y \mid \mathrm{present})\)` by averaging over the missing variables:
 integrate `\(P(y \mid \mathrm{missing}, \mathrm{present}) P(\mathrm{missing}\mid \mathrm{present})\)` over missing

--

 * Key part of puzzle `\(P(\mathrm{missing} \mid \mathrm{present})\)`,
 i.e. model of the relationship of missing and present

---
# Advanced topics for missing data

--

 * Informative missingness

--

  * Uninformative &mdash; "missing completely at random"

--

  * Missing conditional on other variables &rArr; "informative" missingness

--

 * Value of information &mdash; measured in bits

--

  * If you could observe an additional variable, which one?

--

 * Graphical models

--

  * Bayesian (directed) and Markov (undirected) networks

---
# Solutions derived from the general framework

--

 * Prediction: integrate output over missing variables

--

---
# Solutions derived from the general framework

 * Training: integrate likelihood term over missing variables

--

 * Maximum likelihood estimation. Log likelihood with complete data looks like:
 `\(\log P(y_1\mid x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}) + \ldots + \log P(y_n\mid x_{n,1}, x_{n,2})\)`

--

 * Missing data: replace `$k$`'th term with `\(\log \int P(y_k\mid x_{k,1}, x_{k,2}) P(x_{k,2}\mid x_{k,1}) dx_2\)`

--

  * log-integral-likelihood causes trouble &mdash; not same as integral-log-likelihood

--

  * Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms can help here

---
# Looking at conventional heuristics from a Bayesian point of view

--
## Single imputation

  * replace missing value with per-variable mean or most common value

--

  * something like approximating integral with one-point sample

---
## Multiple imputation

  * sample from marginal distribution

--

  * sample from distribution conditional on other variables

--

  * multiple imputation is essentially same as Bayesian approach

---
## "Hot deck" imputation -- replace with most similar complete record

--

  * something like sampling from empirical conditional distribution

---
## Multiple models

--

 * Don't try to use all data to train the same model

--

 * Instead, train one model per combination of missing variables

--

 * Equivalent to constructing conditional distributions `\(P(y \mid x_1, x_3)\)`, `\(P(y\mid x_2, x_3)\)`, etc directly

--

 * Workable when not too many patterns of missing variables!

---
# Worked example: missing variable in classification

--

 * Model is `\(P(c\mid x_1, x_2) = \sigma(x_1, x_2)\)`

--

 * where `\(\sigma(x_1, x_2) = 1/(1 + \exp(-u(x_1, x_2)))\)` is the "sigmoid" function

--

 * and `\(u(x_1, x_2) = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + b\)`
  * Let `$a_1 = 4/3, a_2 = -1/6, b = -35/12$`

--

 * Class 0 has mean `$\mu_0 = (1, 0)$`, class 1 has mean `$\mu_1 = (7/2, 1)$`

 * Same covariance `$\Sigma = (2, 1; 1, 2)$`

# Worked example: missing variable in classification

 * With both variables present, we compute `\(P(c = 1\mid x_1, x_2)\)`

 * Suppose `\(x_2\)` is missing

 * Now we must compute `\(P(c = 1\mid x_1)\)`

---
# Worked example: missing variable in classification

 * Gold-standard result: integrate output over missing variable weighted by `\(P(x_2\mid x_1)\)`.

--

 `\(P(c=1\mid x_1) = {{e^{{{7\,{\it x_1}}\over{4}}+{{1}\over{4}}}}\over{e^{{{7\,
  {\it x_1}}\over{4}}+{{1}\over{4}}}+e^{{{{\it x_1}}\over{2}}+{{49
   }\over{16}}}}}\)`

# Worked example: missing variable in classification

 * Repeat the analysis, this time suppose `$x_1$` is missing. Gold standard:

# Worked example: missing variable in classification

 * Gold standard and approximations, `$x_1$` missing:

<img src="post-class1-given-only-x1-gold-std+all-approx-swapped-x1-x2.svg" width="80%"/>

---
# Worked example: missing variable in classification

 * When the less important variable, `$x_2$`, is missing, all approximations are fairly accurate

--

 * When the more important variable, `$x_1$`, is missing, results vary widely

  * Substituting conditional mean gives more accurate result

  * Substituting unconditional distribution or mean gives very inaccurate results

---
# Missing values are everywhere

---
# Missing values are everywhere

 * Text analysis: parameters are associated with words, but most documents don't contain most words

--

  * Example: Happy words = (smile, glad, joy, goal, win), unhappy = (forgot, grumble, complain);
  what about the text "I was glad that the roof got fixed"?

--

  * Models for text are often so-called latent variable models;
  for these, missing data might have no effect (depending on structure of model) &mdash; good news!

---
# Missing values are everywhere

 * Time-to-event models: death, failure, cancel service, etc

--

  * For subjects which haven't experienced the event you know only that time to event is greater than current age

--

  * It's typically important to take non-event data into account, so exact formulas have been worked out

---
# Missing values are everywhere

 * Pooling data from various sources, for some cases all data are available,
 but some sources not available for all cases

--

  * Example: medical diagnosis; data sources = test results, demographics, personal report,
  recent and not-recent medical records, educational records, etc

--

  * If it's important to account to account for each and every datum,
  a Bayesian network might be appropriate
