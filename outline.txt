Strategies for handling missing data in modeling and prediction

 * What are missing data?

 * Common missing data scenarios

 * A Bayesian framework for approaching missing data problems
 ** "Bayesian" = model all uncertainties as probabilities
 ** consistent strategy: compute conditional probability given what you know, and averaging over what you don't know
 ** Averaging means integrating -- this can be computationally intensive
 ** ... but you always know what you're aiming for

 * Solutions for specific problems derived from general framework

 * Looking at conventional heuristics from a Bayesian point of view
 ** Single imputation
 *** replace missing value with per-variable mean or most common value
 *** something like approximating integral with one-point sample
 ** Multiple imputation
 *** sample from marginal distribution
 *** sample from distribution conditional on other variables
 *** multiple imputation is essentially same as Bayesian approach
 ** "Hot deck" imputation -- replace with most similar complete record
 *** something like sampling from empirical conditional distribution
 ** One model per combination of missing variables

 * Worked examples of specific problems
