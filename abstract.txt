Title: "Strategies for handling missing data in modeling and prediction"

Abstract: Machine learning models are typically phrased in terms of
input and output data, and, often enough, some data have missing
(i.e., unknown) values. I'll talk about some common missing data
scenarios, and present a general Bayesian framework for working with
missing data. I'll show how solutions for specific scenarios can be
derived from the general framework, and I'll note how conventional
heuristics for missing data can be understood from a Bayesian point of
view. Finally I'll present a few worked examples to illustrate
specific problems and their solutions. This presentation will be light
on the math, with an emphasis on the many interesting concepts in play
here.
